# CSSBaseline
`CssBaseline` is a component in Material-UI that helps with the consistency of the baseline CSS for your application across different browsers. 
It effectively resets the browser's default styles to provide a clean slate for your custom styles. This includes setting a consistent box-sizing, margin, padding, and font-family throughout the app. 
By using `CssBaseline`, you ensure that your application looks more consistent across different web browsers and devices. 
It's usually placed at the root of your app to apply its styles globally. Would you like to know more about how to use it in your projects?

# React Helmet
React Helmet is a reusable React component that manages all of your changes to the document head. It's handy for handling changes to your app's meta tags, which can be crucial for SEO.

Here's what React Helmet can manage:
- Title tags
- Meta tags (like `description`, `viewport`, `charset`, etc.)
- Link tags (like `canonical`, `icon`, etc.)
- Script tags
- Style tags
- Base tags
- Noscript tags

Using React Helmet, you can ensure that each page has its own specific meta tags, which are important for SEO purposes as they provide metadata about the HTML document. Meta tags are used by search engines to help index and provide relevant content in their search results.

Here's a simple example of how you might use React Helmet in a component:

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import { Helmet } from 'react-helmet';

const MyComponent = () => (
  <div>
    <Helmet>
      <title>My Page Title</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This is a brief description of my page." />
      {/* Add any other head elements here */}
    </Helmet>
    {/* The rest of your component */}
  </div>
);

export default MyComponent;
```

In this example, when `MyComponent` is rendered, React Helmet will update the document's title and meta description with the specified content. This is particularly useful for single-page applications where the title and metadata need to change as users navigate different parts of the app.

Would you like an example of how to dynamically change these head elements based on user interaction or page navigation?
